    //()`ðŸ’š Assertion Passed: ${actual} === ${expected}`) --> is a regular string with additional functionality for embedding expressions. By using ${expression}, you can insert the value of any JavaScript expression or variable into the string. The expression inside ${} is evaluated and its value is inserted into the resulting string. Template literals provide a convenient way to create strings with dynamic content without having to concatenate multiple strings or use complex string manipulation.
